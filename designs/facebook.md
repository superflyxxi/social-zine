# Facebook Integration
This doc is just about capturing information.

In order to login to Facebook, we'll need to scope the request so we can see user's posts, `user_posts`.
[Scopes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference#u).
Need to do see if devices is the best way to do this, [Devices](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/for-devices).
Or should I use the normal route and present a webpage with a login button [Login Button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web/login-button).
